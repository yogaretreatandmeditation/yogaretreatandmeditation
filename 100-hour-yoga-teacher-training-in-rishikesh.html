It's essential to note that this 100-hour training does not count towards the required yoga teacher training hours, and it does not certify you as a yoga teacher by itself. If your goal is to become a registered yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance, you will need to complete a minimum of 200 hours of training.

                For those seeking Yoga Alliance registration as a yoga teacher, we highly recommend exploring our Complete TTC programs, which fulfill the 200-hour training requirement. All our comprehensive courses, including the Complete TTC programs, are recognized as Continuing Education (CE) training hours for individuals already registered as RYT (Registered Yoga Teacher) under Yoga Alliance (USA).</p>
