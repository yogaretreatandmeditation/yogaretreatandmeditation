          <hr class="w-50 mx-auto">
          <p class=" container lh-lg">Yoga Vidya Mandiram provides yoga teacher trainings in English language over a different duration from 7 days up to 50 days.  During the retreat, students follow 6 days retreat schedule with the 7th day as rest day, during which school organizes a half-day sightseeing for students.  The course fees are all inclusive of classes, food, accommodation and a half-day sightseeing.

            At Yoga Vidya Mandiram in Rishikesh centre, we offer both complete and short Yoga Teacher Trainings.<br>
            
            <br>1. Complete Yoga Teacher Training (TTC) : Complete trainings are certified Yoga Teacher Training Courses (TTC) under Yoga Alliance USA. It is a holistic approach to studying yoga as the TTC lays out important foundation of essential yoga subjects for people who wants to understand yoga and its practices, as well as deepen their practices.  It is not only designed for those who wants to become yoga teachers.  Yoga TTC is most suitable for anyone who wants to delve into the study of yoga in a systematic, practical and well-rounded manner, whether or not they want to become a yoga teacher.  Those who wishes to take the profession of a recognized international yoga teacher is required to take a minimum of 200 Hours Yoga TTC by Yoga Alliance.
            
            <br><br>2. Short Yoga Teacher Training (TTC) : Short Yoga Teacher Training courses (TTC) offers an opportunity for people who are interested in studying yoga in a holistic approach on strong foundations over a short duration.  Please note that Yoga Alliance requires a minimum of 200 Hours of training. Therefore, if you are looking to obtain a certificate that makes you eligible to register as a yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance, please see our complete TTC programs.  All courses are valid as Continuing Education (CE) training hours for those registered as RYT under Yoga Alliance (USA).</p>
        </section>
        <p class="container">Certification for Yoga Teacher Training
For complete Yoga Teacher Training courses, students will be eligible to register as a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) after collecting required teaching hours, if any.

For short Yoga Teacher Training courses, students will receive certificate of completion.  However, these short TTC does not have sufficient training hours to meet the minimum training hours required by Yoga Alliance to be eligible for registering as RYT.  Short Yoga TTC also does not count towards 200 Hours, 300 hours or 500 Hours yoga teacher training hours, because Yoga Alliance requires the complete yoga TTC trainings to be completed in one consecutive training.  For those already registered as an RYT, the hours participated in short Yoga TTC at Yoga Vidya Mandiram may be collected as Continuing Education (CE) Hours by YACEP registered teachers at our school.

          <h2 class="container mb-3 bg-dark text-light">Eligibility for our Yoga Teacher Training </h2>
          <p class="container lh-lg">Doing yoga at home can be one option, but a week of intensive yoga with like-minded practitioners is another. If you struggle to stick to a routine, a retreat could be the ideal way to enhance your practice. During your stay, two sessions a day will help your body and mind reap the benefits, restoring and reviving you. Knowledge and techniques learnt mean your daily life will benefit, boosting mental and physical wellbeing.
            <br>Are you after a method to improve your yoga and join with those who share the same interests? A visit to a yoga retreat might be ideal. Yoga retreats are becoming more desirable as folks look for routes to free themselves from the difficulties of ordinary life and be incorporated in a serene, reflective atmosphere. Here are a few advantages of going to a yoga retreat:
            </p>
          
          <ol class="container text-capitalize text-center lh-5">
            <li><u>Background:</u><p> The training is open to people of any belief system, academic, racial, gender, professional and cultural backgrounds.</p></li>
            <li><u>Language:</u><p> As the medium of the training would be in English, students should have moderate English skills, especially when it comes to listening teacher’s lectures.  We have students with English as a second language attend our trainings all the time.  Some have less English skills than others, but with strong determination and focus in class, many of these students have excelled in class far more than native English speakers.  Therefore, a strong intention and paying close attention in class certainly makes a huge different in how much you gain from the training.</p></li>
            <li><u>Age:</u><p> We would say between 16-70 years of age.  This seems a wide range of age to go through the same training.  However, we have had the youngest student at 17 years to the oldest student at 70 years join us for the training in the past.   Our students between 60-70 years of age were extremely healthy and very active.  Of course, we encourage practicing to each student’s physical, mental and emotional capacity at all times.  It is important to practice non-violence towards yourself at all times and not push yourself over the limit.   Therefore, no matter what age you are at, if you feel able and still seek yoga studies, you are most welcome to study the arts of yoga.</p></li>
            <li><u>Pre-Existing Health Conditions:</u><p> All students who have pre-existing health conditions, both physical, mental and emotional, are required to get advised from their doctor, therapist or psychiatrist before joining the course.  We may request a letter of permission from your doctor, for any serious health conditions.  We also hold the right not to accept a student due to their health conditions, if we feel that our training could trigger any kind of injury.</p></li>
            <li><u> Open-minded:</u><p>  Students may experience a difference between the East and West, in terms of teaching style, cultural values, concept of yoga, perspective on a certain yoga subject, etc.  Students are requested to keep an open mind and be prepared to experience some or many differences between what you might have learnt back home and what teachers are sharing during the course.  The studies and practices of yoga are open to various interpretation and involves adaptation in personal practices to suit each individual in various different way based on each of our own nature and requirements.  We neither impose, nor try to convince that an interpretation or a practice is the right or the best for all.  We provide the tools and students are encouraged to experience what works best for themselves through lifetime of study and practice.</p></li>
