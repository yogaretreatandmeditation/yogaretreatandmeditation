          <p class=" container lh-lg">Yoga Retreat and Meditation provides yoga teacher trainings in English language over a different duration from 7 days up to 50 days.  During the retreat, students follow 6 days retreat schedule with the 7th day as rest day, during which school organizes a half-day sightseeing for students.  The course fees are all inclusive of classes, food, accommodation and a half-day sightseeing.

            At Yoga Retreat and Meditation in Rishikesh centre, we offer both complete and short Yoga Teacher Trainings.<br>
            
            <br>1. Complete Yoga Teacher Training (TTC) : Complete trainings are certified Yoga Teacher Training Courses (TTC) under Yoga Alliance USA. It is a holistic approach to studying yoga as the TTC lays out important foundation of essential yoga subjects for people who wants to understand yoga and its practices, as well as deepen their practices.  It is not only designed for those who wants to become yoga teachers.  Yoga TTC is most suitable for anyone who wants to delve into the study of yoga in a systematic, practical and well-rounded manner, whether or not they want to become a yoga teacher.  Those who wishes to take the profession of a recognized international yoga teacher is required to take a minimum of 200 Hours Yoga TTC by Yoga Alliance.
            
            <br><br>2. Short Yoga Teacher Training (TTC) : Short Yoga Teacher Training courses (TTC) offers an opportunity for people who are interested in studying yoga in a holistic approach on strong foundations over a short duration.  Please note that Yoga Alliance requires a minimum of 200 Hours of training. Therefore, if you are looking to obtain a certificate that makes you eligible to register as a yoga teacher with Yoga Alliance, please see our complete TTC programs.  All courses are valid as Continuing Education (CE) training hours for those registered as RYT under Yoga Alliance (USA).</p>
        </section>
        <div class="alert container alert-danger text-center mt-5">
        <h3>Certification for Yoga Teacher Training</h3>
        <p>For comprehensive Yoga Teacher Training courses, students will have the opportunity to become a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) upon accumulating the necessary teaching hours, if applicable.<br><br>

          In the case of abbreviated Yoga Teacher Training courses, students will be awarded a certificate of completion. It's important to note that these shorter training courses do not fulfill the minimum training hour requirements set by Yoga Alliance for RYT registration. Furthermore, these condensed Yoga TTC programs do not contribute to the accumulation of 200, 300, or 500 hours required for advanced yoga teacher training. This is because Yoga Alliance mandates that the full yoga TTC curriculum must be completed in a single, uninterrupted training sequence.<br><br>
          
          For individuals who are already registered as an RYT, the hours spent in abbreviated Yoga TTC programs at Yoga Vidya Mandiram may be recognized as Continuing Education (CE) Hours. These CE Hours can be credited towards their ongoing professional development under the guidance of YACEP registered instructors at our institution.<br>

          <ol class="container d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-evenly align-content-center align-items-center text-capitalize text-center lh-5">
            <li class="box">Background:<p> The training is open to people of any belief system, academic, racial, gender, professional and cultural backgrounds.</p></li>
            <li class="box">Language:<p> As the medium of the training would be in English, students should have moderate English skills, especially when it comes to listening teacher’s lectures.  We have students with English as a second language attend our trainings all the time.  Some have less English skills than others, but with strong determination and focus in class, many of these students have excelled in class far more than native English speakers.  Therefore, a strong intention and paying close attention in class certainly makes a huge different in how much you gain from the training.</p></li>
            <li class="box">Age:<p> We would say between 16-70 years of age.  This seems a wide range of age to go through the same training.  However, we have had the youngest student at 17 years to the oldest student at 70 years join us for the training in the past.   Our students between 60-70 years of age were extremely healthy and very active.  Of course, we encourage practicing to each student’s physical, mental and emotional capacity at all times.  It is important to practice non-violence towards yourself at all times and not push yourself over the limit.   Therefore, no matter what age you are at, if you feel able and still seek yoga studies, you are most welcome to study the arts of yoga.</p></li>
            <li class="box">Pre-Existing Health Conditions:<p> All students who have pre-existing health conditions, both physical, mental and emotional, are required to get advised from their doctor, therapist or psychiatrist before joining the course.  We may request a letter of permission from your doctor, for any serious health conditions.  We also hold the right not to accept a student due to their health conditions, if we feel that our training could trigger any kind of injury.</p></li>
            <li class="box"> Open-minded:<p>  Students may experience a difference between the East and West, in terms of teaching style, cultural values, concept of yoga, perspective on a certain yoga subject, etc.  Students are requested to keep an open mind and be prepared to experience some or many differences between what you might have learnt back home and what teachers are sharing during the course.  The studies and practices of yoga are open to various interpretation and involves adaptation in personal practices to suit each individual in various different way based on each of our own nature and requirements.  We neither impose, nor try to convince that an interpretation or a practice is the right or the best for all.  We provide the tools and students are encouraged to experience what works best for themselves through lifetime of study and practice.</p></li>
